# Open Ended Questions

## Section 1 - Design & Development

##### Q1 : Could you outline what you would consider to be the important considerations If you were asked to develop a web application that could potentially be used by thousands of users?

**Performance & scalability** - It's important that the application doesn't crash as soon as the product begins attracting more users. A well performing application will not crash or slow down as soon as there are concurrent activities. It needs the capacity to handle increasing workloads depending on the traffic, because the speed of the application will ultimately affect overall user satisfaction.

**Flexibility & manageability** - As the product and technology evolve, you want to ensure the product is designed to be adaptable. If there is focus on keeping it maintainable, it will keep operational costs down by taking developers less time to build it out and modify it.

**Security** - It's important to take precaution and set up multiple forms of validation to ensure bad user params are not sent through with many users accessing the application.

##### Q2 : What techniques do you employ to keep up-to-date with the rapid pace of progress in the field of front-end development? How do you choose which technologies are worth taking the time to learn more about?

If high traffic, popular applications are using the technologies successfully, I will take the time to learn them. Also, I will generally check the documentation and test environment first to ensure that it is something that can be thoroughly tested before incorporating it into any of my projects.

## Section 2 - & Deployment

##### Q1 : Describe the approach you take in testing your applications.

If it's a language I'm comfortable in, like Ruby, I will employ a TDD approach. If it is a technology I am less familiar with, I will generally write out the code first, and then test each feature thoroughly once it appears to be working.

##### Q2 : What do you value in a code base?

Organization and Readability. I like to keep my functions and methods short and easy to follow along with, so it's easy for another person to come in and see exactly what each line of code is responsible for.

## Section 3 - General

##### Q1 : What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development field?

There's always something new to learn, and multiple approaches you can take to solving one problem.

##### Q2 : In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?

I've been working in the industry professionally for over a year now. To date, I am most proud of the fact that in my current job I am a mentor to junior developers. I am still new in this field, but challenge myself every day to learn more in order to teach challenging concepts to students who are seeing it for the first time.
